Click `next` for all now, and click `install`.

The System will restart again.

And congrats your Active directory is now set to Domain Controller!

We now verify if this PC is on the domain by going to CMD and typing `systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"` where `/B` is for finding an exact match.

```
C:\Users\Administrator>systeminfo | findstr /B /C: "Domain"
Domain:                    AD. lab
C:\Users\Administrator>
```

### 29. Setting up the AD Certificate System

We will now go to the `Manage` Tab and then `Add Roles and Features` Again. This time we will select `Active Directory Certificate Service` in the `Server Roles` Tab.
